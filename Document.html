        <p style="margin: 10px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, Courier, monospace;font-weight: 800;">David Goggins (born February 17, 1975) is an American motivational speaker, author, and retired United States Navy SEAL. He is also an ultramarathon runner, ultra-distance cyclist, triathlete, and was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame for his achievements in sports.[5] Goggins was also awarded the VFW Americanism award in 2018[6] for his service in the United States Armed Forces.[7] Goggins also published a New York Times Best Seller book titled Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds. He has often been described as "The toughest man on Earth".</p>
        <p style="margin: 10px; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, Courier, monospace; font-weight: 800;">Goggins was born on February 17, 1975, to Trunnis and Jackie Goggins. In 1981, he lived in Williamsville, New York, on a street called Paradise Road with his parents and brother, Trunnis Jr.[8] While Goggins' neighborhood held "model citizens consisting of white people," he describes his home experience as "hell on Earth."[9] Goggins' father owned the roller-skating rink Skateland, located in East Buffalo, New York. At age six, Goggins often worked the night shift at Skateland alongside his family, organizing roller skates.[8] Goggins' mother left his father due to abuse and eventually moved herself and her sons to live with Goggins' grandparents in Brazil, Indiana.</p>
